ImportError: libblpapi3_64.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Issue >> libblpapi3_64.so is not in a typical directory where the dynamic linker would look for it 

Fix >> 
1. Create a configuration file under /etc/ld.so.conf.d/blpapi.conf
2. Add the library location /home/ishuah/workshop/blpapi_cpp_3.7.5.1/Linux
3. sudo ldconfig
